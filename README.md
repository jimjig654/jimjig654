# 👋 Hey there, I'm GOTHBOYYYY :3

Welcome to my little slice of the internet.

---

## 👀 What I'm Into
- Low-level hardware mischief (Flipper Zero, ESP32, IR tech, you name it)
- Game dev experiments (boomer shooters, DOOM-style projects, Godot/C++/Java chaos)
- OSINT, UAPs, weird tech, and anything that makes people go "wait, that works?"

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Godot Engine (C# and GDScript)
- C++ for DIY game engines
- ESP32 firmware development & WiFi/IR wizardry

---

## 💡 Open to Collaborate On
- Retro-inspired shooters or immersive sim projects
- IR blaster tools & experiments (for legit home testing)
- Niche or fringe tech toolkits with actual utility

---

## 📫 Contact Me
Hit me up via GitHub issues, or send a message through my Flipper (just kidding... kinda)

---

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I once tried to recreate a DOOM-style engine from scratch with zero knowledge... and now I know a little too much about raycasting, random IR protocols, and why your TV might suddenly turn off.
